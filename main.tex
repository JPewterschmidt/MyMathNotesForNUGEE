\section{Definition and Terminology} \label{def-de}
We shall classfy differential equations according to 
\textbf{type, order and linearity}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[Types]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item ODE\footnote{Only the ODE is required by NUGEE.}
            \item PDE
        \end{itemize}
    \item[Order]
        The meaning of \textbf{order} is same as the 
        \textbf{order} of differentiation.
    \item[Linearities]
        The meaning of \textbf{degree} is same as the 
        the \textbf{degree} of polynomial.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verification of Solutions}

A solution of a differnential equation that is identically zero
on an interval $I$ is said to be a \textbf{trivial solution}.

You have to check the solution of a differential equation wether
or not fit it's interval of definition (domain).

\subsection{Function v.s. Solution}

You have to check the solution of a differential equation wether
or not fit it's interval of definition (domain).

The domain of $y = 1/x$, considered simply as a \textbf{function}, 
is the set of all real numbers $x$ except $0$. 

Now $y = 1/x$ is also a \textbf{solution} 
of the linear first-order differential equation
$xy' + y = 0$. (Verify.) But when we say that $y = 1/x$ 
is a \textbf{solution of this DE}, we
mean that it is a function defined 
\emph{on an interval I} on which it is differentiable and
\emph{satisfies} the equation\cite{fcde}.

\section{First-Order Differential Equations}

The \textbf{critical point} of a autonomous differential equation
is a constant number which satisfy $f(c) = 0$.
Meanwhile, $y(x) = c$ is also a constant solution of the equation.

A critical point is also called \textbf{equilibrium point} or
\textbf{stationary point}.

A constant solution $y(x) = c$ is called an 
\textbf{equilibrium solution}\cite{fcde}.

\subsection{Conclusions of Non-constant Solution of A Autonomous}

\begin{definition}
    [Autonomous differential equation] is a First-Order Differential Equations which like
    \[
        \dfrac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} = f(y)
    \]

    Many differential equations encountered in applications or equations that are
    models of physical \emph{laws that do not change over time} are autonomous\cite{fcde}.
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Non-constant solution do not cross the equilibrium solution.
    \item $f(y)$ do not change the signs in a subregion.
    \item a solution $y(x)$ is strictly monotonic in s subregion.
    \item If $y(x)$ is \emph{bounded}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[above] by a critical point $c_1$,
                then the graph of $y(x)$ must approach the graph of the
                equilibrium solution $y(x) = c_1$ 
                either as $x \to \infty$ or as $x \to - \infty$.
            \item[(both)] by two consecutive critical points 
                $c_1$ and $c_2$ (as in subregion where $c_1 < y(x) < c_2$ for all $x$),
                then the graph of $y(x)$ must approach the graph of the
                equilibrium solutions $y(x) = c_1$ and $y(x) = c_2$
                one as $x \to \infty$, the other as $x \to - \infty$.
            \item[below] by a critical point $c_2$,
                then the graph of $y(x)$ must approach the graph of the
                equilibrium solution $y(x) = c_2$ 
                either as $x \to \infty$ or as $x \to - \infty$.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Curves of an Autonomous DE}

\begin{example}
    \[
        \dfrac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = \sin y
    \]

    \begin{verbatim}
StreamPlot[
    {1, Sin[y]}, 
    {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2 Pi, 2 Pi}
]
    \end{verbatim}
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{figure/direction-field-dy-slash-dx-siny}
        \caption{the direction field of $dy/dx = \sin y$}
        \label{fig:direction-field-dy-slash-dx-siny}
    \end{figure}
\end{example}

By the figure \ref{fig:direction-field-dy-slash-dx-siny}, we know
the slopes of lineal elements on a horizontal line are all the same.

Thus we could got 
\begin{corollary}[The Transltion Property of autonomous DEs]
    If $y(x)$ is a solution of an autonomous differential equation
    $dy/dx = f(y)$, then $y_1(x) = y(x - k)$, $k$ a constant,
    is also a solution.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Solutions of Separable Equations}

\begin{definition}
    A first-order differential equation of the form
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:form-of-separable-equation}
        \dfrac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = g(x)h(y)
    \end{equation}
    is said to be separable or to have separable variables.
\end{definition}

You basically convert the euqation \ref{eq:form-of-separable-equation} into
\begin{align*}
    1/h(y) \mathrm{d}y &= g(x) \mathrm{d}x\\
    \int 1/h(y) \mathrm{d}y &= \int g(x) \mathrm{d}x
\end{align*}
after that, you could get the solution(s).

Sometime, the antiderivatives of each side could not be 
representde by a elementary function. 
In this case, the solutions could only be represented by a 
integral-defined function
\[
    y(x) = y_0 + \int_{x_0}^{x} g(t) \mathrm{d}t
\]

\subsection{Solutions of a Linear First-Order DE}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Remember to put a linear equation into the standard form
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:standard-form-of-linear-ODE}
            \dfrac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} + P(x) y = f(x)
        \end{equation}
        both the coefficient function $P(x)$ and $f(x)$
        \textbf{are continuous on the interval $I$}.
    \item 
        From the standard form of the equation 
        identify $P(x)$ and then find the
        integrating factor
        $\exp\{\int P(x) \mathrm{d}x\}$
        . 
        No constant need be used in evaluating the
        indefinite integral $\int P(x) \mathrm{d}x$.
    \item 
        Multiply the both sides of the standard form equation by the integrating
        factor. The left-hand side of the resulting equation 
        is automatically\footnote{See also \cite[page 55]{fcde}} the
        derivative of the product of the integrating factor
        $\exp\{\int P(x) \mathrm{d}x\}$
        and $y$:
        \begin{equation}
            \dfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}
            \left[
                e^{\int P(x) \mathrm{d}x} y
            \right]
            =
            e^{\int P(x) \mathrm{d}x} f(x)
        \end{equation}
    \item 
        Integrate both sides of the last equation and solve for $y$\cite[page 56]{fcde}.
\end{enumerate}

Function
\[
    \mu (x) = e^{\int P(x) \mathrm{d}x}
\]
is called \textbf{integrating factor} for equation \ref{eq:standard-form-of-linear-ODE}.

\begin{example}
    IVP:
    \[
        y \dfrac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}y} -x = 2y^2, \quad y(1) = 5.
    \]
    \cite[page 63]{fcde}

\end{example}

\section{Exact Equations}

\begin{definition}[Exact Equation] \label{def:exact-equation}
    A differential expression $M(x, y) \mathrm{d}x + N(x, y) \mathrm{d}y$
    is an \textbf{exact differential} in a region $R$ of the 
    xy-plane if it corresponds to the differential of some function
    $f (x, y)$ defined in $R$. 
    A first-order differential equation of the form
    \[
        M(x, y) \mathrm{d}x + N(x, y) \mathrm{d}y = 0
    \]
    is said to be an 
    \textbf{
        exact
        \footnote{
            An equation is called \emph{exact}
            when it can be expressed as 
            the derivative of a function 
            (often referred to as a potential function 
            or a primitive function). 
            In other words, equations satisfied \ref{eq:criterion-for-an-exact-differential}
            would be called exact.
        } equation
    } if the expression on the 
    LHS is an exact differential.
    \cite[page 65]{fcde}
\end{definition}

Once we get the \emph{exact equation}, 
we could get the implicit solution(s)
via some way.

\begin{theorem}[Criterion for an Exact Differential]
    \label{criterion-for-an-exact-differential}
    Let $M(x, y)$ and $N(x, y)$ be continuous and 
    have continuous first partial derivatives 
    in a rectangular region $R$ defined by $a < x < b, c < y < d$. 
    Then a necessary and sufficient condition that 
    $M(x, y) \mathrm{d}x + N(x, y) \mathrm{d}y$ be an exact
    differential is
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:criterion-for-an-exact-differential}
        \dfrac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} = \dfrac{\partial N}{\partial x}  
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
 
The equality of the mixed partials is a consequence of 
the continuity of the first partial derivatives of $M(x, y)$ and $N(x, y)$.

The sufficiency part of Theorem \ref{criterion-for-an-exact-differential} 
consists of showing that there exists a function $f$ for which
\[\partial f/ \partial x = M(x, y)\] and \[\partial f/ \partial y = N(x, y)\]
when ever (\ref{eq:criterion-for-an-exact-differential}) holds.
The construction of the function $f$ actually reflects a basic procedure
for solving exact equations,

In other words:
\[
    \dfrac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \dfrac{\partial N}{\partial x}  
    \Longrightarrow 
    \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x} = M(x, y) 
    \bigwedge
    \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} = N(x, y) 
\]

We can find $f$ by integrating $M(x, y)$ 
with respect to $x$ while holding $y$ constant:
\[
    f(x, y) = \int M(x, y) \mathrm{d}x + g(y)
\]
where the arbitrary function $g(y)$ is the \emph{constant} of integration. 

After that, 
\[
    \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}
    \int M(x, y) \mathrm{d}x + g'(y) = N(x, y)
\]
then you can get the $g'(x)$, moreover by integrading $g(y)$ also got.

\begin{example}
    IVP:
    \[
        \dfrac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = 
        \dfrac{xy^2 - \cos x \sin x}{y(1-x^2)}, \quad y(0) = 2.
    \]
    \cite[page 68]{fcde}
\end{example}

\subsection{Integrading Factor}

Multiplying a \textbf{integrading factor} on both side of a nonexact equation
\[
    \mu (x, y) M(x, y) \mathrm{d}x + \mu (x, y) N(x, y) \mathrm{d}y = 0
\]
could convert it into a exact equation.

See also \cite[page 68]{fcde}.

\section{High-Order Differential Equations}

\subsection{Reduction of Order} \label{reduction-of-order}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Put equation
        \[
            a_2(x)y'' + a_1(x) y' + a_0(x) y = 0
        \]
        into 
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:standard-form-linear-DE-2}
            y'' + P(x)y'x + Q(x)y = 0
        \end{equation}
        where $P$ and $Q$ are continuous on some interval $I$.
    \item Suppose $y_1$ is a konwn solution of \ref{eq:standard-form-linear-DE-2} on $I$
        and that $y_1(x) \neq 0$ for every $x$ in the interval.
        if we \textbf{define} $y = u(x)y_1(x)$, it follows that
        \begin{align}
            y'  &= u y'_1 + y_1 u' \notag\\
            y'' &= uy''_1 + 2y_1'u' + y_1 u'' \notag\\
            y'' + Py'x + Qy &= 
                u\underbrace{
                    \left[y_1'' + Py_1' + Qy_1\right]
                }_{
                    =0 \mbox{, \,= equation \ref{eq:standard-form-linear-DE-2}}
                }\notag\\
                &+ y_1u'' + (2y_1' + Py_1) u' = 0 \label{eq:before-rename-of-linear-ODE-when-reduction-order}
        \end{align}
    \item Let $w = u'$, thus equation \ref{eq:before-rename-of-linear-ODE-when-reduction-order} turns into
        \[
            y_1w' + (2y_1' + Py_1) w = 0
        \]
    \item By separating variables and integrating, we obtain
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:another-sln-reduction-order}
            y_2 = y_1(x) \int \dfrac{e^{-\int P(x) \mathrm{d}x}}{{y_1}^2 (x)} \mathrm{d}X
        \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Homogeneous Linear Equations with Constant Coefficients}

\begin{example}
Solving $ay' + by = 0$ for $y'$ yields $y' = ky$, 
where $k$ is a constant. This observation reveals
the nature of the unknown solution $y$.

\emph{The only nontrivial elementary function whose
derivative is a constant multiple of itself is 
an exponential function} $e^{mx}$.

If we substitute $y = e^{mx}$ and $y' = me^{mx}$ into $ay' + by = 0$, 
we get
\[
    ame^{mx} + be^{mx} = 0 \quad \mbox{or} \quad e^{mx}(am + b) = 0
\]
Since $e^{mx}$ is never zero for real number $x$, that's impiles
\begin{equation}\label{eq:a-simple-example-of-aux-equation}
    am + b = 0
\end{equation}
For this single value of $m$, $y = e^{mx}$ is a solution of the DE.
Equation \ref{eq:a-simple-example-of-aux-equation} is called \textbf{auxiliary equation}.
\end{example}

The foregoing procedure can produce exponential solutions
for homogeneous linear higher-order DEs.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:standard-form-high-order-homogeneous-linear-DE}
    y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + \ldots + a_1y' + a_0y = 0
\end{equation}
where the Coefficients $a_i, i = 0, 1, \cdots, n$ are real constants
and $a_n \neq 0$.

For 2-order HLDEs, we have auxiliary equation
\[
    am^2 + bm + c = 0
\]

There're 3 types of solution which we can use:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\Delta > 0$] We could get two solutions: 
        \[
            y_1 = e^{m_1x} \quad \mbox{and} \quad y_2 = e^{m_2x}
        \]
    \item[$\Delta = 0$] We could get one solution directly: $y_1 = e^{m_1x}$.
        The other solution could be solved by the equation 
        \ref{eq:another-sln-reduction-order}
        \begin{align}
            y_2 &= e^{m_1 x} \int \dfrac{e^{2 m_1 x}}{e^{2 m_1 x}} \mathrm{d}x = e^{m_1 x} \int \mathrm{d}x \notag \\
                &= x e^{m_1 x}
        \end{align}
    \item[$\Delta < 0$]
        If $m_1$ and $m_2$ are complex, then we can write
        \[
            m_1 = \alpha + i \beta \quad \mbox{and} \quad m_2 = \alpha - i \beta
        \]
        the general solution is
        \begin{equation}
            y(x) = e^{\alpha x}(c_1 \cos(\beta x) + c_2 \sin(\beta x))
        \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
